# Hardware API

## Common provisions

#### Terminology

The terminology of [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) (specifically __must__, __should__, __may__ and their negatives) applies.  The word __will__, when applied to the Hardware Service API ("the API"), has the same meaning as __must__.

#### Protocol

The API supports communication over HTTPS only.

#### Encoding

The API supports communication using JSON encoding only.  The client __must__ submit the headers `Content-Type: application/json` and `Accept: application/json` for all requests.  Failure to do so __will__ result in a `415 Unsupported Media Type` response.  The API __will__ include the header `Content-Type: application/json` with its response.

#### Authentication

The API is authenticated by a JWT bearer token.  Two token sources are accepted:

* Tokens generated by Amazon Cognito and acquired from the [`accessory/login`](#Login) endpoint;
* Tokens generated by Amazon Cognito and acquired as part of authentication to the Users Service;
* Tokens returned from the Website service's `/token` endpoint as the value of the `access_token` property.  See the documentation at [/Website/README.md#Oauth]().

The client __must__ submit the header `Authorization: <JWT>` with all requests. Failure to do so, or submitting an invalid or expired JWT, __will__ result in a `401 Unauthorized` response.  

#### General responses

In addition to the AWS API Gateway responses and the specific responses for each endpoint, the server __may__ respond with one of the following HTTP responses:

* `400 Bad Request` with `Status` header equal to `InvalidSchema`, if the JSON body of the request does not match the requirements of the endpoint.
* `404 Unknown` with `Status` header equal to `UnknownEndpoint`, if an invalid endpoint was requested.

## Schema

### Simple

The following simple types __may__ be used in responses:

* `string`, `number`: as defined in the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) standard.
* `Uuid`: a `string` matching the regular expression `^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$`, that is, the string representation of an [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) UUID.
* `Datetime`: a `string` matching the regular expression `/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}(Z|+\d{2}:\d{2})/` and representing a date and time in full [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format.
* `MacAddress`: a `string` matching the regular expression `/{[0-9a-f]{2}(:[0-9a-f]{2}){5}/`, that is six groups of two hexadecimal characters, separated by colons.
* `VersionNumber`: a `string` matching the regular expression `/\d+\.\d+(\.\d+)?/`, that is a [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) version number (in either `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` or `MAJOR.MINOR` format)

### Accessory

An `Accessory` object __must__ have the following schema:

```
{
	"battery_level": Number,
	"bluetooth_name": String,
	"firmware_version": VersionNumber,
	"mac_address": MacAddress,
	"memory_level": Number,
	"state": String
}
```

The following constraints __will__ apply:

* `battery_level` and `memory_level` __must__ be a number between 0 and 1 inclusive.

### Sensor

A `Sensor` object __must__ have the following schema:

```
{
	"battery_level": Number,
	"firmware_version": VersionNumber,
	"gyro_offset": [ Number, Number, Number]
	"mac_address": MacAddress,
	"memory_level": Number,
}
```

The following constraints __will__ apply:

* `battery_level` and `memory_level` __must__ be a number between 0 and 1 inclusive.
* `gyro_offset` __must__ be a list of exactly three Numbers.

### Firmware

A `Firmware` object __must__ have the following schema:

```
{
	"device_type": string,
	"version": VersionNumber
}
```

The following constraints __will__ apply:

* `device_type` __will__ be one of the strings `accessory` or `sensor`.

## Endpoints

### Accessory

#### Register

This endpoint can be called to register a new accessory.

##### Query String
 
The client __must__ submit a request to the endpoint `/accessory/{mac_address}/register`, where `mac_address` __must__ be a MacAddress. It __should__ correspond to the MAC Address of the accessory.

##### Request

The client __must__ submit a request body containing a JSON object with the following schema:

```
{
    "password": String,
    "hardware_model": String,
    "firmware_version": VersionNumber,
    "settings_key": String
}
```

* `password` __must__ be a string containing 8 or more characters, with no leading or trailing spaces.
* `hardware_model` __must__ be a string of between 1 and 256 characters.  It __should__ uniquely identify the hardware model of the accessory.  This value is immutable.
* `firmware_version` __must__ be a VersionNumber, which __should__ identify the version of the firmware installed on the accessory.
* `settings_key` __must__ be a string of between 1 and 256 characters.

```
POST /v1/accessory/1d:3a:42:5d:g5:ea/register HTTP/1.1
